    The vast majority of the similarity score labels in STSB are in the set
    [0, 0.2, 0.4, ..., 4.8, 5.0]. So, we first round the number to the closest
    entry in this set, and then we convert the result to a string (literally e.g.
    "3.4"). This converts STSB roughly into a 26-class classification dataset.

      label: original label.
